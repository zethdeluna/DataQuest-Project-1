    "The `Category` frequency table above shows a much more accurate representation of the population of apps in the Google Play store. We can clearly see that \"FAMILY\" apps are the most present at 18.44%, followed by \"GAME\" at 9.87% and \"TOOLS\" at 8.44%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike what we saw in the Apple Store data, no app category in the Google Play store holds a dominating majority. This data shows that apps geared toward family friendly are most prevalent in the Google Play store. This may indicate that family friendly apps are in the highest demand. To investigate further, we checked Google Play and it seems that the \"Family\" category no longer exists (date checked: July 5, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](gp_categories.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we think about the \"family genre\" in other markets (i.e. movies, TV, activities, etc.), the one factor that they all have in common is that they are geared towards the kids. Parents may enjoy the experience as well, however it is important for the products to be designed so that young children would be able to comprehend and enjoy the experience. Pixar, for example, produces animated movies with complex underlying themes and scenes that portray serious topics, like mental illness or the passing of loved ones. This allows for the parents to watch the movie for themselves, to be moved emotionally rather than just playing it for the kids. However, at surface level, they are made for the enjoyment of a younger audience&mdash;fun adventures, action, comedy, friendly looking characters, story lines that are easy enough to understand, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, bringing this back to our analysis, we can probably assume that the \"family\" category in Google Play consisted of apps made for kids. And if we look at the rest of the categories, it is most likely that these kids apps are actually games (I highly doubt that developers would make tools, lifestyle, or business apps for kids). So, we can estimate that the \"Game\" category actually represents about 25 - 30% of the Google Play market. Even with this increase in the percentage held by the Game category, we can still see that apps in the Google Play market are more evenly balanced between apps that are fun and apps that are practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point, we found that the Apple Store market is dominated by apps that are geared towards fun, and the Google Play market has a good balance between apps geared towards fun and apps geared towards practical uses. The analysis, so far, has given us the most popular genres based on the number of apps available per genre. To get an idea about the kind of apps with the most users, we must do some further analysis."

    "## Most Popular Apps by Genre\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to find out what genres are the most popular (have the most users) is to calculate the average number of installs for each app genre. This information is available in the Google Play data set in the `Installs` column, however it's not included in the Apple Store data set. As a workaround, we can observe the total number of user ratings, which we can find in the `rating_count_tot` column. Because a written review implies that the user has experienced the app, it will be safe to assume that most of an app's reviews have been written by users that have downloaded and installed the app.\n",

    "### Apple Store's Most Popular by Genre\n",

    "Let's start with calculating the average number of user ratings per app genre on the Apple Store. To do that, we'll need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Isolate the apps of each genre.\n",
    "* Sum up the user ratings for the apps of that genre\n",
    "* Divide the sum by the number of apps belonging to that genre (not by the total number of apps).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll create a frequency table for the `prime_genre` column using our `freq_table()` function (remember that the values are percentages, but for our purposes now only the keys are needed).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we'll loop through the unique genres. For each genre, we will loop through the Apple Store data set and count the number of apps that match each genre and the sum of user ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can calculate the average number of user ratings by dividing the number of user ratings by the number of apps per genre.\n"

    "\n",
    "In this project, we analyzed data about the Apple Store and Google Play mobile apps with the goal of recommending an app profile that would be profitable for both markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that in the Apple Store, the games genre accounted for a majority of the apps that were available for download. However, the amount of apps alone could not provide enough information about how many users actually downloaded and installed the apps. So, we took a look at the number of installs per genre for both the Apple Store data set and the Google Play data set. This data provided accurate information about how many users were installing apps in each genre. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since our goal was to develop an app that would be successful in both markets, we would recommend spending the company's time and energy into developing a social media app. The social media genre ranked at #3 in the Apple Store data set and the Google Play data set in terms of average number of installs. Navigation and Reference from the Apple Store, and Communication and Video Players from Google Play had higher averages than Social Media, but, again, our goal is to develop an app that would succeed in _both_ markets."
